# Slate Protocol Governance

This document outlines the governance model for the Slate Protocol project, including how decisions are made and how various members of the community can participate.

## Core Principles

Our governance model is guided by the principles of transparency, responsiveness, and a long-term commitment to decentralization. We believe that a clear and open decision-making process is essential for building a healthy and sustainable open-source community.

## Current Governance Model: BDFL & Core Team

In its current, early stage of development, the Slate Protocol operates under a "Benevolent Dictator for Life" (BDFL) model, led by the project's founder.

**Project Lead (BDFL):** Anteneh T. Tessema (@Anteneh-T-Tessema)

The Project Lead has the final say in decisions regarding the project's technical and strategic direction, including merging pull requests, resolving disputes, and guiding the overall roadmap.

The Lead is supported by a Core Team of maintainers who are responsible for reviewing contributions, managing the repository, and helping to shape the project's direction.

## Core Team Responsibilities

- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Triaging and managing issues
- Upholding the project's Code of Conduct
- Engaging with the community and mentoring new contributors

## The Path to Decentralization

While the BDFL model is effective for the initial, rapid development phases of the project, it is not our long-term vision. Our ultimate goal is to transition the governance of the Slate Protocol to a decentralized, on-chain model driven by the community of $SLT token holders.

The roadmap includes the eventual implementation of a governance framework where protocol upgrades and parameter changes are proposed and voted on by the community. This document will be updated as we move closer to that milestone.

## How to Get Involved

The best way to influence the direction of the project is to be an active and constructive member of the community. We encourage you to:

- Participate in discussions in GitHub Issues and Pull Requests
- Join our community Discord server
- Contribute high-quality code, documentation, and feedback

Active and trusted contributors may be invited to join the Core Team over time.
