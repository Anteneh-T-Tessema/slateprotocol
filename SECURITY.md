# Security Policy

The Slate Protocol team and community take the security of our codebase very seriously. We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and community members who help us maintain a high standard of security.

## Supported Versions

We are currently in active development. Security updates will always be applied to the latest version on the main branch.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| main    | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We believe in responsible disclosure. If you discover a security vulnerability, we would greatly appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a private and responsible manner.

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to:

**security@slateprotocol.org**

Please include the following details in your report:

- A descriptive title
- A detailed description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability, including any proof-of-concept code
- Any suggestions for a potential fix, if you have one

## Our Commitment

- We will make our best effort to provide a private, preliminary response to your report within **48 hours**
- We will work with you to understand and validate the issue
- We will keep you informed of the progress toward a fix and full announcement
- We will credit you for your discovery once the vulnerability is resolved, unless you prefer to remain anonymous

We do not currently have a formal bug bounty program, but we plan to establish one in the future.
